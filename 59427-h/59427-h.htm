there <i>is</i> a good market for the oil from Rape, and that
in fact we at present import it to supply the demand.
We refer all interested in Rape culture to the little

<p class='c006'><i>Magazine</i> reached us on the 15th, with its appearance
much improved. On further consideration we
have decided to keep the clubbing price with it and
<span class='sc'>Gleanings</span> at $1.75, and $5.00 for all the Bee Journals.

<p class='c006'>Mr. Doolittle, of Borodino, and L. C. Root, of Mohawk,
N. Y., have each sent us a club of 20 subscribers,
Prof. Cook, and several others, nearly as many. A
few more such friends and we might afford to give
you a larger Journal and larger type, <i>without</i> any
change in price.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'>Our thanks are due J. C. Colborne, of Chicago, for
a description of the hive and frame used by Mr. Harbison.
It is not a suspended frame, nor is it like
Quinby’s. We should prefer getting something more
definite, and from Harbison himself, if possible, before
giving it to our readers. Dimensions of frame about
12×15.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our mailing type goes by machinery that won’t
work unless 75c. be remitted once a year. Therefore
look to the labels on your papers and see when your
time will be out. If the paper stops coming blame the
“machine” and not us; also, if the labels do not always
present your account to you monthly, as it should
be, drop us a postal.</p>

<p class='c006'>We presume nearly every one of our readers, has
already done something for the relief of the Kansas

the opportunity presented them, we would refer to
Mr. James Vick’s proposal in his Floral Guide. His
arrangements enable him to give a receipt for all
money, and to also show how and where it has all
been judiciously expended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding all that has been said about
honey dealers, we have at least two men in whom we
feel we can place implicit confidence; Lippincott of
Pittsburg, and Muth, of Cincinnati. Mr. Muth has for
many years been dealing in supplies, and we have yet
to hear a single complaint of him in any shape or
manner. His honey jars are very neat indeed, and
what is more they will hold an honest pound, or 2 lbs.,
according to the stamp in the glass of each. As an
instance of the magnitude of his business, we may say
that he has given the manufacturers orders for 1000
gross for the coming season; customers may depend
on getting goods as soon as ordered.</p>

<p class='c006'>My bees, 50 stocks, on their summer stands, are not
doing well; weather very cold, some days below zero
all day. A good deal of ice in hives, with not sufficient
warm weather to thaw it and dry them out. Have
lost some already, and shall lose more if the weather
does not change soon.</p>

Friend Novice:—While I freely endorse the
most that is contained in the article on, How to
Conduct an Apiary, in the Dec. No. of <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>,
I will have to dissent from a few of your conclusions,
even at the risk of being accused of <i>heresy</i>
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>For instance: that the position that keeping bees
warm etc., will save them, will have to be given up,
and, since our wintering troubles, **** nothing that
has been done has amounted to a row of pins, [Beg
pardon, we meant toward curing sick ones.—Ed.] except
fine weather etc. Now the above may be true in
the case of your bees, but I cannot think it will apply
to many. I have pretty strong evidence that keeping
my bees warm and quiet, <i>did</i> save them, as most of
those in this neighborhood that were not wintered in
warm depositories have perished with the bee disease,
during the last two or three winters. Keeping mine
warm has, in my opinion, amounted to a pretty long
row of pins—a longer one in fact than any one would
need, unless they wished to start a notion store, and
even then they might be overstocked.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not think that I have ever claimed that cold
was the <i>only</i> but merely the <i>main</i> cause of the losses
that have occurred. The want of dryness and darkness
in the winter depository has no doubt had considerable
to do, in some instances, with the loss of
bees that were housed, while disturbance, caused by
taking a light in the room, looking at the bees, admitting
strong currents of air, by opening the door at
night, and introducing artificial heat has no doubt
killed more bees than anything else, except cold. A
prominent bee-keeper remarked last spring, that he
regarded artificial heat as being indispensable in wintering
bees; right in the face of the fact that he had
lost about eight-ninths of his bees by its use, or at
least, while using it. Rather a poor argument in its
favor, I think. But I may be too practical in my views.
Bees are very sensitive, and a slight jar, taking a light
into the room etc., will often excite them to an injurious
activity. I have frequently seen the advice given
to open the door of the winter depository at night to
cool and purify the air, but if the ventilators are arranged
as they should be, I would much rather depend
on them and keep the door shut.</p>

<p class='c006'>You remark on page 139 of Dec. <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>, that
opening the door and windows of your cellar only
seemed to make the bees warmer. It no doubt had
just that effect, as the bees were stirred up by feeling
a current of air different from that in the room, [but
what <i>should</i> we have done?—Ed.] and strong stocks,
when disturbed, generate an immense amount of heat.
I had a pretty fair sample of what they can do in that
line two years ago when I put my bees in the house.
We had a cold south-west wind at the time. The
thermometer stood at about zero in the open air, and
at 34° in the house when I began carrying the bees in.
By having the door open it sunk to 20° in the house,
by the time I had them in. I put in 88 swarms,—then
shut the door for two hours,—when I went in again
and they had run the thermometer up to 45°, being 11°
higher than it was before the door was opened to put
them in. It remained about the same all the time out
of doors. By letting them alone, they soon became
quiet and the temperature of the room fell to about
40°. Keeping bees <i>too warm</i> will excite them, and will
have the same effect as keeping them too cold, cause
them to fill themselves with honey, and if the excitement
is kept up long, the result will be the same—they
will be effected with the dysentery.</p>

<p class='c006'>The thermometer in my bee house stands at 42° at
this date, Dec. 14th, 1874, and a person on entering the
room would almost think there was not a live bee in
it, they are so still.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the Editor, and all his readers, may succeed in
carrying all their bees safely through the present, and
all subsequent winters, is the wish of <span class='sc'>James Bolin</span>.</p>

<div class='c016'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/capw.jpg' width='50' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
We mentioned last month that we gave
the bees in the forcing house a brisk fly
on the 17th, to accomplish this more effectually
we removed the covers to all the hives, and
this was one reason why only <i>four</i> bees remained
on the sash. They saw their comrades
just beneath them and of course “hopped down”
among them. To avoid giving any erroneous
impression we may remark that we spend the
greater part of our Sundays with our books
and papers in the forcing house, and on sunny
days even the rest of the family find it an
agreeable sitting room. Of course we do not
mean to work with our bees on the Sabbath
and should be very sorry to have any of our
readers get such an opinion of us, yet it must
be admitted that it so came about, that the
<i>bees</i> instead of being allowed to rest on the
Sabbath, rested <i>six</i> days, and on the seventh
were expected to turn out and have a fly if
nothing else. If they would not otherwise, we
uncovered the hives etc., as above. Very likely
friend Bolin will expect this treatment to kill
them whether or no. Never mind; they would
probably submit with resignation if they knew
it was solely in the cause of science. On the
23rd, we warmed the house in the afternoon
and made search in nearly all the hives for
eggs, but none could be found. We were anxious
to report brood in Jan., in our Feb. No.,
and so kept the room at a favorable temperature
all day the 24th, and next day were
delighted to find that the Queens had laid profusely,
even to the lamp nursery which
contained less than 100 bees with the Queen at
this time. By the way we can see no difficulty
in wintering any number of Queens with a tea-cupful
of bees each, in this way. Our
last form was to be printed on the 27th, and to
get larvæ before this time required careful
work, so we kept the room warm until the last
item was set up, but “not a larvæ” could we
see, and we dolefully sent you your papers
with hardly a parting note in regard to our
experiment. On the 28th we looked again and
were cheered with the sight of whole patches
of larvæ, so large it seemed we must have been
hasty the day before. And now for pollen.
Few of the colonies had any at all, some of
them positively none, and the worst of it was
the bees would take no notice of the spot where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>they had worked so industriously on it in Dec.
They seemed to take their flights close under
the glass. On the 31st we were rejoiced to see
the sun come out full and clear, and by 10
o’clock the room was abundantly warm without
any aid from the stove, but not a bit would
they notice the meal. We had read in the <cite>Fruit
Recorder</cite> that plants, especially strawberries,
must be placed <i>close up to the glass</i> to thrive.
Was it not so with bees? In a twinkling the
Simplicity hive cover containing the heap of
meal was suspended from the sash within about
a foot of the glass. Our better half here interposed
that it was long past church time and we
bent our steps churchward with about as much
alacrity as did we when in the woods with the
wild Touch-me-nots. We were late, and what
is more were rebuked by having the minister
pause in his discourse until we could get seated.
Never mind we deserved it and will try
and do better next time. May our path through
life never lead, where the influence of such as
he is unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you wonder that we were in a mood to
rejoice more fully, with the bees, when we
found them happy as in June, dancing about
our heap of meal, and now and then scampering
into their hive as fast as their padded legs
could carry them. Yet this was a cold wintry
day outside, and the sun scarcely thawed the
snow on the south roofs of the houses.</p>

<p class='c006'>We should have said before, that our second
sash were put in place about the middle of Jan.
It has not yet been closed up warm and secure
by any means, but it does excellent service in
keeping the ice from the glass and preventing
the attendant drip.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feb. 1st</i>—To-day we had sunshine again, and
brood rearing is going on beautifully. The
only drawback is the drunken bees that blunder
about and finally fall on the floor; these
we gather up in the evening and put in the
lamp nursery where they revive and at least a
part of them go through the same programme
next day. Not all, however, for the lamp nursery
is getting built up thereby. We forgot to
mention that one colony was found Queenless;
search showed her dead in bottom of hive. As
she looked natural and perfect, and as the
bees were healthy, we cannot think it any
fault of our own that we now have 67 colonies
instead of 68.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Feb. 8th</i>—I hope and trust that I have many
warm friends among our readers, many who
have followed my efforts, in years past, and very
likely who feel that they know my weak points
almost as well as those who have held daily
converse with me, face to face. If I have gained
any hold upon you, and if you have any
confidence in my truth and candor, please listen,
and do not turn away, even if I talk a little
to you on these pages, on something, that does
not <i>directly</i> pertain to Bee Culture.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a little time back a great light has been
breaking above me. This light might have
come sooner had it not been for several things
which stood in its way; prominently among
them, a vain pride and ambition in regard to
this very <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>. I worshipped worldly
things first, and my Maker, (when I worshipped
Him at all) afterwards. In fact when this
great light commenced to reveal itself, I debated
whether it was best to mention the matter
at all, here; whether it would be—well, <i>profitable</i>.
When these thoughts arose, the old darkness
threatened to come back, until I could
truly say, “I will do my Creator’s work first
<i>whatever</i> it may be, and bees and all else afterwards.”
Dear readers do you know that this is
one of the first tasks shown to me, to use my
influence whatever weight it may have, in all
possible directions, to induce imperfect mankind
to say with me <i>Thy will</i> our Heavenly
Father, not ours be done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you say you have no duties that you are
aware of, left unperformed? just as I did a very
few days ago? Go read your Bible, read the
commandments and see. When you have tried
to live up to these, when you have tried to love
your neighbor <i>as yourself</i>, and find you <i>cannot</i>
do it alone, admit your helplessness and call
on your Heavenly Father for aid, but first be
sure you can freely give up all or <i>everything</i> in
this world for His sake, and forgive all your
fellow beings, as you hope to be forgiven.
With a sincere prayer that God will enable
these few words to reach you just as they were
intended, I still remain <i>more than ever</i> your old
friend A. I. Root.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'><i>Feb. 12th</i>—Reports come in from all sides in
regard to the extreme severity of the weather,
and brood rearing in the forcing house is again
suspended on account of the thick coat of ice
that covers the sash and prevents even the
noonday sun from penetrating and warming it
up. Instead of feeling like being dissatisfied
with such weather ought we not rather to take
it as a lesson that our climate is uncertain, and
that we should in building our wintering
houses, cellars etc., make proper calculation
for such extremes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feb. 15th</i>—Still zero weather. The forcing
house is so completely covered with ice that
even the noonday sun scarcely has an effect on
it. In Jan. <cite>Am. Agriculturist</cite>, Mr. Quinby describes
the behavior of bees in cold weather, and
also reiterates the statement made last season
that the solid portion of the honey they eat
during winter is evacuated in a dry state, and
may be found on the bottom board of the hive,
when the bees are in health. As soon as the
paper was received we commenced some experiments
to determine (as we supposed) the truth
of the matter. We soon decided that Quinby
was utterly wrong in both, and prepared to
write a severe criticism. We are sincerely glad
we did not for the spirit that was then prompting,
was more a disposition to show that Mr.
Q. was in error, than to get at the truth <i>whereever</i>
it might lie. What we did was to raise a
hive up from the bottom board, remove cover
and quilt and subject them to severe cold
weather. Although the colony (nucleus rather)
contained not more than a quart of bees,
they seemed to bear this without detriment. A
sheet of white paper was placed under the cluster,
and after a few hours the brown particles
that had accumulated were examined. We
thought then there was nothing there but bits
of comb, propolis etc., but a more candid examination
since has convinced us that, in some
hives at least, the bees do void their excrement
in a dry state, and perhaps they always do in
perfect health. The second point was to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>how the bees behaved when it was cold; strange
to tell they did not behave at all. They were
simply, perfectly still, “dead as door nails,” as
Gallup used to say. We approached on tip-toe,
and examined them by day light, and by lamp
light, but it was all the same. We fixed our
eye on a single bee, and watched it until our
teeth chattered, but it seemed perfectly comfortable
on the outside of the cluster. When
the temperature became lower, quite a hum
came apparently from the center of the cluster,
but we could see no movement that should
produce this; the bees that were visible, did
not move their wings, and did not change
places. Now then, when do these bees get
food, and if they change about, why could we
have not seen <i>just one</i> in the act of so doing?
We confess we do not know, will some one else
help? During the experiment once or twice, a
bee would crawl out of the cluster and fly off
in the cold and fall down and die. We then
took a distant position, and saw the same phenomena,
and from the number of bees found
scattered about, we think it occurs about the
same whether they be disturbed or not. A bee
that is sick crawls out of the cluster, and out
of the hive if he can, and dies. As they die
thus, most in the forcing house, we may infer
that brood rearing aggravates the trouble, or
what is more probable <i>to us</i> is, that sudden and
wide changes of temperature, such as we always
have in the spring are severe on bees as
well as on vegetation. The forcing house varies
from 40 to 70°, now, almost daily. If this
be true, our bees had better be kept in doors
until April, or even later, if we can manage to
do so; and those using the cold frames, should
keep them covered and dark, except at intervals,
until the days get pretty warm. All colonies
have a pretty fair patch of brood, in the
forcing house, it is true, but the old ones are
dying off so fast, we fear we are gaining little.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feb. 16th</i>—Found Queen in lamp nursery
dead on bottom. The bees looked bright and
all right, and she looked natural, except that
her body was somewhat distended. Our utter
helplessness, in the matter is illustrated in the
following:</p>

<p class='c020'>During the last three winters, I have suffered heavy
losses, and the matter has been a great puzzle to me.
My reports of the last three seasons would have been
much better, had my bees wintered well. I have for
the last six winters kept my bees in an exceeding dry
cellar, with an average temperature for the whole
time of about 37°. For three winters they did well,
then came disaster. To my mind, none of the causes
and methods or theories advocated cover the whole
ground or seem absolute remedies for this fatality in
wintering. I firmly believe that it was an epidemic (or
perhaps more properly an “apidemic”) sent by Providence
for purposes His own. The most curious part
in my experience is that stocks so nearly alike that
I could detect no <i>slight</i> difference in quality, were affected
so differently—one dying or becoming very
weak while the other wintered in fine condition.</p>

EDITORS GLEANINGS:—You ask me to report
results of the past season. I started last spring
with 100 swarms, thinking this about the number
one man should attend to, and considering it about as
many as should be kept in one place, especially as
there are over 150 swarms within one mile of us.</p>

<p class='c006'>After placing bees on their summer stands which I
did about the middle of April, my first business was to
remove all combs except those occupied by the bees.
Number of combs left in would vary from 3 to 7 giving
space in hive to be kept warm according to quantity
of bees. And here let me say that no one thing helped
me more towards success, than did the Quinby frame,
by the use of which I could contract or enlarge space
in brood chamber at pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>The yield of honey from willow, apple, raspberry,
and clover was light. My principal business up to the
first of July was taking combs filled with brood from
strongest swarms to help weak ones, and filling their
place with empty combs. Basswood commenced
blossoming about the 20th of July. Then came our
flush. I increased my stock to 123 swarms.</p>

  <h2 id='QUINBY' class='c009'>QUINBY HIVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The following in regard to the Quinby hive
is just at hand.</p>

<p class='c020'>You say on page 15 that “in justice to ourselves we
would smile to see the person who would dare undertake
to find the Queen or extract the honey from a
dozen Q. hives as quickly as we could from a like
number of our suspended frame hives.” <i>I</i> would smile
to see yourself, or any one else undertake to do it one-half
as quickly as some half dozen I could name.
Again, on same page, “where one has plenty of leisure
Mr. Quinby’s cheap hive has many advantages, and
we may be mistaken about the time needed by an expert
to open and close these hives.” Now would it
not be candid to say that Mr. Hetherington, Mr. Elwood,
Mr. Van Deusen, and Mr. L. C. Root, have as
much sense as common folks. Now what can be the
object of using said hive, when hundreds have to be
looked after if there was nothing to be gained from it.
It is necessary for Mr. H. to work fast, if it is for any
one. It is his business. He has used box, straw, and
modification of Langstroth—has a thousand dollar’s
worth on hand, that he does not use, now. To suppose
that he has thrown aside all this property without
being quite sure he can work with greater facility
with the hive he is using is paying his judgment a poor
compliment.</p>

<p class='c019'>It seems to us Mr. Q. writes a little unkindly,
but perhaps we deserve it. In a matter of
so much importance there should be no arguing,
and no strife. Even should there be a test
trial of the two hives, made by two experts,
the result would be of little use to our rising
bee-keepers. The question is, how will the
people at large succeed best. At present we
really know of no better way than for those
who are undecided, to try one hive of each
kind; what suits your neighbor exactly, may
not suit you. Our having the Corners for sale,
should make no difference in our opinion, and
we try not to let it, but we cannot help wondering
if Capt. Hetherington has ever tried a
hive with these Corners.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the <cite>Am. Agriculturist</cite> for Feb., the Quinby
hive is described with illustrations. The frame
differs a little from the one we described last
month, in having the top bar also, dropped a
little below the ends of the side pieces; also,
the top and bottom bars are both alike and
lighter. Dimensions there given are, uprights,
11×1½×½. Top and bottom, 18⅜×⅜, cut from
inch boards. Ends are nailed firmly with finishing
nails into top and bottom but projecting
beyond them as has been mentioned, ¼ inch.
The hoop iron hooks to hold the frames in an
upright position, if they be used, can probably
be bought cheaper of Mr. Q. than they can be
made. The sides and top of the hive are made
of ½ inch boards, planed smoothly, just the
size of the frames, with cleats nailed on each
end to prevent warping. The bottom board is
11×20×1, also cleated on under side to prevent
warping. Mr. Q. says tie all together with a
stout rubber cord, but it seems to us this cannot
prove a very durable fastening.</p>

Friend novice:—Enclosed find 75 cents for the
next year’s crop of “<span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>.” I have just
sewed 1874 together and I would not take $5.00
for it if I couldn’t get another. My bees are sound
asleep in their pit at present, and will remain there
until about “St. Pathrick’s day in the mornin’.” I
took the precaution this fall of planking the top and
sides of the pit, also of putting two doors in the front
end, something as described in Dec. <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>. My
observing neighbors tell me that I had better have
let well enough alone, and buried them in the dirt as
usual, but I thought a permanent place if as successful,
would be better. If you remember, I used to have
trouble about my bees swarming as soon as strong.
Well as you told me, I found regular and thorough
extracting a perfect remedy, but I soon had my hives
jam full of brood. The two story plan was “no good,”
as my hives are practically <i>three</i> story ones now. I
did not want to get new hives and I could see no way
of building a story, like Pat’s house “on behint.” I
solved the difficulty in this manner, I moved the hive
half its width to the right or left and set another hive
exactly like it, by its side, with the entrance the same
way, and took half of the combs from the old stock
and placed them in (without any care which hive had
the Queen) and filled up each with empty combs, and
run them through the height of the season in that
manner, supplying the Queenless one with brood from
the other as I extracted, and carefully destroying all
Queen cells as I extracted each week. Of course I
only practised this with Queens that were very prolific
and had their hives <i>boiling</i> over with bees, and united
again as soon as honey failed and the brood was sufficiently
contracted. I foresee and forebear all the objections
that will be urged to this plan, and the main
one will be, “Why didn’t you let your Queenless hive
hatch a Queen?” Well, I’ll tell you, I wanted to see
how much honey <i>I</i> could get from 25 stocks of bees
even if some of the stocks did live in what we call out
West a “double house.” I don’t pretend that it is any
better than the “long idea” plan, except that when I
wanted to contract my stock I had no “empty rooms”
to carry into winter quarters. I am satisfied that the
mammoth yields are from mammoth colonies. My
yield is called enormous here but is small to what
some report. I started with 17 colonies that had to be
fed until June 15th. I increased by dividing, to 25
Queens, and gave 3 of them, double colonies as before
described. I got 2150 lbs. of honey, 2000 lbs. of which
was choice, and put 24 colonies into winter quarters
well supplied with stores. I wasted the time of four
of the best, for four weeks of the best part of the season
trying to get some box honey. All I got for my
trouble, was my pains, and the natural swarms, which
I summarily returned, after throwing those honey
boxes as far as I could send them, extracting every
one of their <i>sealed combs</i> full of honey and destroying
their queen cells. Let those who can, <i>raise</i> box honey,
I had rather raise extracted for 4c per lb. than to wait
all summer for box honey and then get none, for a
dollar a pound. The boxes were put on “according to
Hoyle,” they had nice starters, they were tight, and
all right every way only the bees would not move in.
I am afraid they are the Novice breed and aren’t in
the box honey business. After I took off the boxes
and took their honey, <i>didn’t</i> they work though?</p>

<p class='c026'>Well Novice, I’ve spun this yarn long enough now
and am not half done, if you get tired reading why
throw the whole away. If I ever come within fifty
miles of Medina I am going to stop and see you and
bore you worse than I do by letter. I’ll tell you how I
sold my honey.</p>

<p class='c026'>Wyoming, Wis. Dec. 16th, 1874.</p>

<p class='c019'>Don’t go to the expense of coming here, friend
J., it would hardly pay you we fear, but do
keep on giving us just such sketches from your
Apiary. We <i>do</i> believe you have hit on a plan
that will prove many times quite practicable.
For instance the Simplicity hive with, Langstroth
frames, <i>so long as one story will hold the
bees</i>, is to us the simplest, and easiest handled
of any thing we have ever used in the shape of
a bee hive, and we have studied long and earnestly
in regard to some plan of uniting two of
them side by side. All of these plans required
too much tinkering. If we made holes for
communication, through either hive, bottom
board, or cover, these holes would have to be
plugged up at other times, and would look ungainly.
Your plan of using them without
other means of communication, than through
the entrance, we confess is novel and so far as
your experiment is concerned, seems quite
practicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>He who shows us how we can keep pace
with modern improvements, and still keep the
hives we have already in use, is truly a benefactor.
To use the Simplicity hives thus, both
entrances should be turned to the south, and
the two hives placed close together. The covers
in this case should be hinged to the front
so as to turn up against the grape vine trellis,
or hinges may be dispensed with entirely. In
the height of the season, both hives can be
pushed, well forward over the bottom boards,
thus making the entrances the whole length.
Should this prove “too much entrance,” bank
sawdust up by the outside corners. In making
so many new colonies last season, we governed
the size of the entrances to exclude robbers,
almost entirely with sawdust, and it answered
the purpose more completely to our satisfaction,
than any other plan we have ever used.
Also, when the nights became cool, we banked
sawdust clear around the hives, to close the
cracks between the hive and bottom board.
We are a great friend to sawdust; it keeps
down the weeds, gives you a clean place to
work, is clean and orderly for a small dooryard
for the bees, and enables you to make
just such an entrance as you desire. Beg
pardon we forgot <i>sawdust</i> wasn’t our topic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our Standard hive with its permanent bottom
board without cracks, and its capacity for
18 or 20 combs without any fussing etc. etc.,
would perhaps be best, but then, “we haven’t
got ’em,” as friend J. says, and just at present
we rather prefer to use the hives we have
already in use.</p>

MR. NOVICE &amp; CO:—Arn’t we greenies glad that
we settled down on <i>our own Standard</i> frame
before you <i>decreed</i> something that one must
print the dimensions with chalk over his work bench
lest he forget it. <i>We</i> dislike the everlasting vulgar
fractions and odd and even numbers about the size of
frames. <i>We</i> adopted 12 inches inside of frame—144
square inches of emptiness—until filled with comb.
Now any body can remember this size—and every one
can build outside their frames just what kind of hive
he pleases. It is just the nicest frame for taking in
one hand, and for turning this way and that way for
inspection and work, and also for leaving one hand to
do something else, and we do find plenty for the free
hand to do—all it <i>can</i> do sometimes. Then for shipping,
why they are just the nicest and handiest frames
ever made, and for housing too, hives of 10 frames pack
away like brick in a wall. So you see we are not a bit
sorry for ourselves—and we are so glad to have the
ladies with us, we have Mrs. Tupper who is a representative
character and carries the women with her
in this matter. Of course we are sorry your wind-mill
won’t work for us in the wood work of our hives at
the “Standard prices” but we can’t be driven by wind
into abandoning our 12×12—“On this firm rock etc.”
Why our hives are so jealous they won’t let one frame
of the Factory of the Wind, enter their yard now—we
have no doubt that to set down one of your vulgar
fraction and odd number frame hives would raise a
mighty buzz and set all the 12 inches on a revolution
against any such vulgar innovation. By the way we
have got a hive “the likes on’t you never did see.”
We took the Alley hive—paid the right to it too—and
now we have some Alley, and some Quinby, and some
of our own whims, and it is going to be just the nicest
and handiest of a’ the bee gums that can be found
in Patentdom or out of it. May be we’ll tell you what
it is some day—if you want us to bother you.</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><i>We</i>—that is we greenies—use the Isham honey box—the
nicest, staunchest, and handiest honey box <i>we</i>
ever saw. We know him he lives round here, he <i>has</i>
a patent on his box—we saw his papers, all reg’lar—he
deserves them too—has lately sold three counties
to an apiarian who has seen a good many such affairs,
and sold for a handsome sum. If you saw it, you
would want a State at least—the <i>work</i> would suit your
taste.</p>

<p class='c026'>Now to finish all this rigmarole and to convince you
that we are your friend, tho’ we expect you will blow
us with a stiff breeze, we say—we frankly confess, that
we have tried your tin corners for frames, after using
wooden ones, and we don’t want to see in our hives
another frame that has not those same tin corners.
And our <i>green</i> advice to all beginners is, don’t make a
single frame till you get these corners. We shall get
rid of all our frames which have not these corners just
as fast as we can. We have tried several hundred of
them and now we send our orders for 6500 more <i>with
the cash</i>, as evidence that we mean what we say.</p>

<p class='c026'>[We can give full address to any who may desire,
but the writer at present prefers a nom de plume.—Ed.]</p>

<p class='c019'>At the risk of having the above sound something
like a puff for the corners, we have decided
to give it a place, especially as some
disparaging remarks that have been given
might tend towards giving an impression that
the corners hardly deserve. We will cheerfully
give place to anything on the contrary side,
coming from any Apiary where they have been
considerably used.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our friends are in error about Mrs. Tupper
using a frame 12×12 <i>inside</i>. Variety of taste
has dictated so many different thicknesses of
the stuff composing the frames, that we cannot
see how our friend gets rid of fractions by
using <i>inside</i> dimensions as a standard. We
have seen end bars in use <i>one inch</i> in thickness
and top bars with a massive comb guide still
thicker. Supposing we all should adopt a uniform
size inside of frame, where would be the
outside, and what would be dimensions of hive
to suit? We can readily make metal cornered
frames to agree in outside dimensions, with
any frame in use, and this allows them to be
worked in the same hive mixed up with the old
ones, thus giving the owner a fair chance to
contrast their lightness, ease in handling, and
at the same time greater capacity for brood
and honey, from the larger comb surface.</p>

<p class='c006'>We certainly don’t want any of your friend’s
“rights” but if you will send us a sample of
his honey box, we will cheerfully help him sell
it, if we think it meritorious. Let <i>him</i> manufacture
and supply all demand, and let his patent
papers protect him in so doing. Nice
honey boxes should be made by machinery,
and ordinary bee-keepers would prefer to buy
rather than to make them.</p>

  <h2 id='A' class='c009'>A NOVEL IDEA IN WINTERING.<br /> <span class='small'>WITH SOME OTHER IMPORTANT FACTS.</span></h2>

<div class='c025'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/capi.jpg' width='50' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
I have used several hives with an outside case
filled in between with straw or leaves, for five or
six years. Also hives with double boarded sides
and ends with dead air space between the boards but
I fail to see that they do any better than the single
boards. Last winter a small colony in a hive of ½
inch boards wintered well without any protection except
the quilt covering on top, and the entrance closed
with a piece of wool when the weather was freezing.
I have two small colonies (made up in the fall of my
nucleus hives) in the same hives, and they have stood
thus far as well as others. The only difference that I
see, is that they are more apt to fly out when the sun
shines brightly, and need shading.</p>

<p class='c026'>Another experiment.—I saw it stated that empty
space beneath the bees was of great advantage. Last
winter I removed all the frames from the lower story
of a hive and left the colony to winter in the upper
story. They did well, but it was a very fine strong
colony and proves nothing. This winter I have quite
a weak colony wintering in the upper story and doing
very well so far.</p>

<p class='c026'>Third experiment.—Some years ago I was preparing
my bees for winter by removing frames from upper
story and putting on quilts. In one very strong colony
the bees remained on top the frames in large numbers.
I pulled off an old wool hat and placed over them and
spread the quilt over that. I found the bees filled the
hat and remained in it all winter. Since then I have
used all the old hats I can find. I notice in some instances
that half the bees of the colony are in the hat.
When those in the hat get hungry, and those below
get cold, how nice and easy it is for them to exchange
places, much easier than to go from the outside of the
cluster to the inside over or around the frames—that
is, provided that is their way of doing—for instance,
when one little fellow’s feet get cold he goes inside to
warm them, and another little fellow comes out to
take his place. This I believe is the generally received
theory. I noticed it so stated lately by one of our
most distinguished bee masters, (M. Q. in <cite>Am. Agriculturist</cite>).
As I never saw any such commotion among
them as would necessarily be the consequence of all
this changing in cold weather, you must excuse me for
being somewhat skeptical about. Has anyone <i>actually
observed</i> this continual changing places in cold weather?
Akin to this is another statement we frequently
see made—that the colder the weather the more the
bees require to eat to keep up the animal heat. This
is all very nice in theory, but so far as I have observed,
the bees are very quiet and still in cold weather,
and scarcely consume any honey at all. These may
be subjects worthy of investigation. I don’t propose
to discuss them here.</p>

<p class='c026'>I have experimented some with the Adair-Gallup
long idea hive, or rather “New Idea” long hive. I
used two hives three feet long, one with large frames
13 square—the other with my standard narrow frames.
I gave them the strongest colonies I had, and I must
confess that neither of them gave as much satisfaction
as the plain two story hives. They may not have been
long enough (<i>?</i>) they did not swarm and did not fill the
few empty frames I gave them.</p>

<p class='c026'>I am aware that these experiments do not conclusively
establish any particular fact or theory in bee-keeping
but they may throw a little light on some
points, and I find them useful in my own practice.</p>

<p class='c019'>Friend S. it seems, has the rare good sense
to see that single experiments do not settle a
matter by any means. We are quite taken up
with the old hat idea. Get one just large
enough to hold your colony, and keep plenty of
sealed honey below them, and they will be in
the <i>best possible</i> wintering trim, if we know
aught of bees. We once wintered a colony
without any honey board. We supposed they
had been given the ordinary allowance with
the rest but may have been mistaken. They
were out of food before March, but they had
commenced to rear brood briskly—rather in
advance of the rest.</p>

It is at least too bothersome for <i>me</i> to make the
Harbison frames, as per <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>; I have made
some very nice frame boxes, top and end pieces
all 1½ inches wide, ends are 5 inches long and top and
bottoms 6¼ inches long and nailed to end pieces,
which are ¼ thick and top and bottom ⅛ inch thick;
outside sections are 1¾ wide with a groove to receive
a glass 5×6. I place the pieces in a long bottomless
box or frame, wedge them up together and nail them,
and then fasten strips of stout paper across them. I
forgot to say in the proper place, that for an entrance
I cut a notch in each side of the bottom pieces ¼×2
inches. I leave the bottom pieces wide because it
makes a better box and is more convenient, one box
can be raised up and another placed under it without
much danger of killing bees, use a wax guide in each
frame.</p>

inside our large frames. Quinby advises this with his
new hive, and illustrates it in <cite>Am. Ag.</cite> for Feb.—Ed.]</p>

<p class='c020'>Almighty Father! We pray that thy blessing may
accompany each separate number of our little Journal
on its mission among the bee-keepers of our land.
May each and every one of us bear our losses during
the present and ensuing months, should such there
be, with a proper spirit of resignation to events we
cannot control. Give us also that cool, calm, and deliberate
frame of mind, that best prepares us to look
earnestly about, and see what means thou hast placed
within our reach to avert a repetition of our past
troubles during the spring months. Give us submission,
without a spirit of idleness, and teach us to work
while we pray. Enable your servant to deserve the
great trust, that he has never until <i>now</i> felt has been
accorded him. Give him that humility that will enable
him to forget self and labor honestly for the benefit
of his brother bee-keepers, and to deserve the confidence
they repose in him.</p>

<p class='c026'>This is the month for feeding the rye and oat meal,
with most of our readers. Put in shallow boxes out
of the wind, but in the sun as much as possible. Here
is a chance for you to exercise your ingenuity in so
arranging a glass sash, as to secure these conditions,
and yet not trouble the bees by having them bump
against the glass by mistake. If they don’t notice the
meal, as some complain they will not, start them by
giving a piece of comb honey laid in the midst of the
meal; get a few bees on the comb from several hives
until they have got a taste, if you cannot start them
otherwise. When they begin on natural pollen they
will take little notice of the meal. Equal parts of
oats and rye <i>ground fine</i> seems to please our bees best.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c026'>We are very sorry indeed to be obliged to say that
we think “Money in the Apiary” by H. A. Burch, by
no means worth the price (25c.) asked for it. The
more so as our relations with Mr. B. of late have been
of the most friendly nature, and he has uniformly
spoken well of <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>. The book is entirely too
small, containing only about one-fourth the matter of
a single number of any one of our Bee Journals.
King’s Bee-Keeper’s Text book, only costs 15c. more,
and yet it is a work of 140 pages, condensed, and to
the point, alphabetically indexed, etc. etc. Money in
the Apiary contains less than 20 pages, less in size,
and some of it unimportant matter at that. We advertised
the work without seeing it which we regret,
but it would be unkind, and do no good now to find
fault with what is past; shall we not rather consider a
remedy that will do justice all around? Our advice
would be that Mr. Burch give his patrons <i>four</i> just
such pamphlets, for the 25c. he has received, and make
it a quarterly. If he will do this, we will give him a
standing advertisement gratis.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c026'><i>Feb. 24th.</i>—All three of the hives, that we are wintering
out-doors, have come through so far in good
condition so far as bees are concerned, although they
spot their hives and the ground badly. The hive bro’t
from a distance worst of all; the one prepared with
woolen by Miss A., next, and the Standard hive best
of all. The latter stands just where, and just as it did
when we left off extracting, has had no preparation
nor tinkering, and is all in complete trim to extract
again, so soon as its 20 combs are filled. Could we be
sure of making a whole Apiary winter like this one,
we should feel quite relieved, even if we <i>were</i> obliged
to put two fair colonies into every hive to do it. The
Queen has just commenced laying. We were agreeably
surprised to find that almost every bee from these
three safely regained their hives, while those in the
forcing house, collect in masses on the glass, get
nearly all of them into one hive, and seem in a fair
way at present to become utterly demoralized, although
they have reared quite a patch of brood during
this month in some of the hives. Will others using
the cold frames, please send us minute reports?
Even though our own now looks discouraging, we are
going to give it a careful test to the best of our ability,
clear through.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It will be observed that we have among our
advertisements, one of the Finn Bee Hive.
In receiving this, we feel it a duty to state
frankly our opinion of the matter, and then if
the parties think we should, we will cheerfully
return the $1.00 they have paid us for this one
insertion. Of course what we say here must
only be taken for our own opinion, and in the
matter of selling rights we may have been unduly
severe. In matters of this kind it is a
very safe rule to ask ourselves if we are honestly
doing as we would be done by.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Messrs Keyes &amp; Finn made hives for sale
such as they advise and sold them for a fair
price, there could certainly be no wrong, for
very many bee-keepers of late stoutly affirm
that bees do winter safely in hives well protected,
on their summer stands, while those side
by side, not so protected, perish. In order to
show both sides of the question, we give the
following:</p>

<p class='c020'>They are stowed away in boxes parked with straw.
Kept good in that way winter of ’72 and ’73, all that
were packed early. Those that were packed in Jan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of same winter died, though stronger in bees and
honey.</p>

<p class='c026'>At present, Feb. 10th, 38° below zero. I put 28 hives
in the cellar and have lost one. They are too cold,
temperature varies from 29 to 34°. I would prefer 42°
as nearly as possible to keep them. I put up 20 in
rough boxes on summer stands, boxes six inches larger
than hives, filled in with shavings. I have wintered
so two years and never lost any. They seem in
fine condition but it is quite expensive—cost me $15.00
to put up the twenty hives but think it pays well.
Would like to have them all put up in the same way.
One of my neighbors had three stocks in box hives
and has lost them all, think the loss will be quite
severe in this vicinity.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c026'>Having had the pleasure of a visit to the Apiary of
J. S. Hill &amp; Sons, near Mt. Pleasant, I will, with your
permission, Mr. Editor, say a few words in regard to
it. Any one entering their bee yard can see at first
glance that there is the best of order, system and
management. It contains 85 large Langstroth hives
completely storm and weather proof, adapted alike to
the storms and zero cold of winter, and the broiling
sun of July and August. Perfect ventilation with no
possible chance of a draft of cold air on the bees, and
no danger of moisture of frost in the hive to give the
bees the dysentery.</p>

<p class='c026'>Mr. Hill having years ago been convinced that cellar
wintering would not do in our changeable climate, has
given a great deal of thought, time and attention to
the business of out-door wintering; that he has made
it a success, is proven by the fact that his loss in the
past four or five years, has been very light, in fact
scarcely any loss at all; while others all around him
lost heavily. He manages to get them through winter,
strong in numbers and is not troubled with colonies
dwindling down in spring and deserting their hives,
as did so many the past two years where they had
been wintered in cellars and other repositories. Mr.
Hill is a firm believer in strong stocks—in keeping
them strong the year round—takes the position that
the only sure way to have strong colonies in early
spring, is to see to it that they are strong in the fall.
His location is not nearly as good for honey as many
others, yet the amount he takes yearly would satisfy
many of us who are in more favored localities; his
only dependance for surplus, is white clover, having
no poplar, linden, or buckwheat, consequently the
honey season is rather short, ending by July 1st.
The hive used by Mr. Hill is, of course, not a dollar
hive, and would perhaps be thought, by some bee-keepers,
to be entirely too expensive, but all things
considered I believe it to be the cheapest for out-door
wintering.</p>

<p class='c026'>Lyons Station, Ind. Jan. 6th, 1875.</p>

<p class='c019'>Were we to stop here, we might think the
matter settled, but why does Quinby now advise
a hive with only <i>half inch boards</i> as a protection.
His large hive was most perfectly adapted
for packing material on all sides of the
bees, even to a thickness of 8 or 10 inches. In
the large Apiaries about him would it be fair
to suppose they had abandoned this plan before
giving it a fair trial? We should much
like to hear from Hetherington, Elwood, and
others in this matter. See letter on page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>.
The testimonials in regard to the Finn hive
are none of them from practical bee-keepers
such as are known through the Journals, and
none of them owners of large Apiaries. If we
wanted to make a hive such as they describe
in their circular we assuredly should not think
of buying a right for the privilege, but if they
would make us a hive at a reasonable price
suitable for receiving our frames, so that we
could easily set a colony into one, we would
prefer to buy of them rather than make one.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Adam Grimm, and Capt. Hetherington
will give their opinion in regard to double wall
hives compared with single ones for out-door
wintering, we will cheerfully pay any reasonable
sum for service. During our protracted
cold weather, many complaints have come in,
in regard to ice forming in hives left out-doors,
and many losses are reported already. In
cases like these, we do think the straw mats a
great advantage, and is it not possible that
they are as efficient as the expensive double
walls?</p>

Five stocks Queenless in spring. Increased
them to 37 in fall, in apparent good condition to winter.
From 6 stocks in non-swarmers, took 560 lbs. box honey;
from the best, 110 lbs., from the poorest, 65 lbs.
Built up and increased the remaining stocks, and took
760 lbs. liquid white honey from them. Fed in the fall,

honey stored. But the fall was unusually fine. <i>Four</i>
stocks devoted to box honey, gave 128 lbs., an average

<p class='c006'>Last year I tried small frames something like Harbison’s,
only I had them so that the bees could work
all ways through them—could tier them up etc. It
was on a Quinby hive or rather frame, put small
frames on sides and top, got between 90 and 100 lbs. of
comb honey and one swarm of bees besides. I shall
try them several ways the coming season. The best I
have done with boxes is about the same as above. My
frame is 14×10 inches, inside measure—have three New
Idea hives—bees swarmed out of them while I was extracting
in spite of all I could do. How’s that?—never
saw such a season for swarming—returned most of
mine. I have only 26 swarms and do not want to increase
if I can help it for I cannot attend to them. I
winter in a large cellar and lose no bees, keep up my
experiments winter as well as summer— that’s half the
fun. Most of my frames are so placed that the boxes
come up plump against the <i>ends</i> of frames and are just
as close to the brood as those on top and in fact the
guide comb is a good deal nearer, and no bee can
stick his head out at the ends, unless he sticks it in the
boxes; but I forget you are no box man!</p>

  <h2 id='HOW' class='c009'>HOW TO FLY BEES IN A ROOM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c016'>In the spring of ’73 bought two colonies of bees,
having poor health thought the attention to them in
the open air would be beneficial; finding the business
so pleasant and profitable concluded to make it a permanent
business, and have given my whole attention
to it. Increased my two colonies to ten, bought 12
more, making in all 22. All came out good in the
spring of ’74, and I got 2100 lbs. box honey and 400 lbs.
extracted, and increased to 47. I have now 65 colonies
in my cellar all in good condition except one, which
showed signs of dysentery. I gave them a fly, and
this is how I did it. Took pine strips one inch square,
made a frame 4 feet square and 2½ deep; covered
sides with news-papers tacked on, spread papers on
the carpet of sitting room near south window. Set
my frame on it covering the top with mosquito bar,
set hive outside with entrance opening into it through
a hole cut in paper. Waited until bees were all quiet
then warmed up room to 65°, standing thermometer
against hive; all flew well for five hours, cleaned out
their hive, and as darkness came on, all returned to
hive again, making it a perfect success. The papers
were badly soiled. Shall serve the rest the same if
necessary. By flying them this way with but a trifling
expense you need not lose a bee. Winter my
bees in cellar with dirt walls, temperature 40 to 45°,
cellar very dry. I use Langstroth hive, got most of
my honey in 20 lb. boxes, two boxes cover a hive—not
quite as salable but I get good deal more honey in
large boxes. Box honey averaged me 24c. per lb.,
extracted 20c. per lb. Extracted only to give room for
the Queens to lay.</p>

I have no Linden seed on hand at present. The
seed should be planted in the fall or kept in damp
sand and planted <i>early</i> in spring. As a general
thing the seeds are about two-thirds bad. I think
cuttings are best to raise plants from. They nearly all
grow, if rightly handled. I sell the cuttings in spring
at 30 cts. per 100, free by mail.</p>

<p class='c019'>The above answers many inquiries. In the
fall of 1871 we gathered and planted about a
half peck of basswood seed, according to the
directions given in Fuller’s Forest Tree Culturist.
So few of these came up that we never
used them at all, preferring to get our 4000 for
the 10½ acres from the forests. We have reason
to think that basswoods grow better when
partially shaded, than in the open ground. On
a part of our lot, there are about 50 large white
oaks; we at first hesitated about planting the
young trees among these, but now find
those among them, have made the best growth
of all. Perhaps many of our readers have noticed
the rank vigorous growth that these trees
often make when young, where they stand in a
thicket of bushes and briers sometimes in fence
corners. Shading the ground around the roots,
from the hot sun, when young, we think perhaps
an important item. Although we have
never tried cuttings, we think it probable they
would answer excellently. A tree on one of
our streets that was planted out with some
maples about seven years ago, blossomed last
year for the first time, but it was taken up
when so large that it did not begin to grow,
until about three years after transplanting.
For reasons mentioned, we should advise close
planting at first, say 10 or 12 feet apart, on a
plan similar to the one given in Vol. 1, pages
2 and 25, for locating hives in the Apiary.
When the trees get crowded, thin out. The
timber will soon pay all expenses.</p>

Listen to the patent right vender and do nothing
but shake your head, says the <cite>Rural New Yorker</cite>,
but I don’t approve of that way. My Mother
often told me when I was little that I would learn to
<i>butt</i> if I shook my head so much. I will tell you how
I served an “Agent,” of some kind. I was in my Apiary
working with my bees, and he laid his satchel on
a hive that was near, and while he bothered me, he
still kept knocking the hive with his satchel. The
bees began to get cross, but he didn’t think you know.
Pretty soon the bees came out and “went for him”
lively, he began to dodge and slap, but he soon grabbed
his satchel and began to “beat a retreat,”
slapping and cracking his head with the satchel and
spoiling his fine hat all to pieces, he “hollered” back
he had enough of the bee business and left. It was
laughable to see him “light out.”</p>

<p class='c026'>V. McBride, [page 11, Jan. No.] says that during the
winter of the malady, all the bees in Langstroth hives
died, and two-thirds in others etc. I saw bees in all
kinds of hives that died, some in box hives from one
foot to five feet high and some in some old washing
machines turned up side down, others in the gable end
of a house, some in the old straw hives and all kinds
of patent hives, and by the way they died in all kinds,
about the same. Some had the patent hives and
lost their bees and then blamed the patent hive, but I
found it was their fault oftentimes, as it makes it a little
handier for them to divide their bees and to take
their honey. They think the patent hive ought to
make honey without bees almost. I guess the “<i>king</i>”
don’t manage right some how as some of those old
farmers call them; don’t you think Mr. Root, that it
is the King’s fault that the bees die?</p>

<p class='c019'>We guess it must be the <i>King</i> friend O., for
we feel sure the <i>Queen</i> is not to blame. Our
very best colony in 1873, dwindled down to the
weakest in the spring of ’74. They went down to
a mere handful, swarmed out twice, and it was
only by giving them hatching brood several
times that we could barely get the Queen
through until July, and then she proved herself
fully equal to what she had been the season
before; in fact she kept putting two or more
eggs in a cell all through the spring months.
It is only the <i>workers</i> that die off as soon as
brood rearing commences. The very same
process is now going on in our forcing house
(Feb. 5th.) yet the brood will get ahead we
think. Keeping the sick bees warm in the
lamp nursery revives them some but they soon
die nevertheless. The idea advanced that it is
a kind of <i>fly</i> that kills the bees, can certainly
have nothing to do with our losses.</p>

<h3 class='c027'>NOW FOR THE HOT-BED.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Jan. 22nd, we let the sun in to the pit and at 2 P. M.
there was a perfect jollification, just like a lot of young
bees playing in summer. And they <i>did</i> “spot” things
inside the pit at a great rate, showing they needed a
fly. As soon as it began to cool down they all went in
to the hives except some dead ones on the straw, no
more than would have been found if they had flown
the natural way, and about two-thirds of a tea-cupful
which were stuck on the sash in groups from one to a
dozen. These latter we brushed out on a dust pan and
put in top of one of the hives, as they were still alive,
and said hive was mighty “sassy” too; seemed strong
in bees, plenty of honey, and combs dry. The pit was
not dug till after the ground was frozen 8 inches deep,
consequently there was considerable frost on the
glass which we swept off as soon as the sun loosened
it a little. The dampness inside the pit was soon dried
and everything went lovely.</p>

straight, but it won’t always work unless the old
combs have brood or sealed honey at the top. I have
had the old combs widened out so as to fill the whole
space, and nothing put in the empty frame at all. I
believe this will always happen if empty frames are
inserted immediately after extracting. The remedy
is, use the Standard hive, move back the division
board just to give room for one frame at a time, move
back the combs till you come to the middle of the
brood nest, insert the empty frame there, and, Ho!
you will have the whole frame nearly filled, with nice
worker comb, <i>and eggs too</i> before morning perhaps.
This should only be done when the bees are gathering

<p class='c006'>Mr. D. Dubois, Newburg, Orange Co., N. Y.,
sends us an ingenious plan for a movable portico
to be applied to any kind of a hive. It is
made of two boards 4×11 inches, fastened together
at the top like a letter A. Now imagine
the horizontal cross bar on this letter, a button,
with a screw through the centre to hold it up
firmly to the hive, and you have it all. Each
end of this button is made with a projection
that enters a slot cut in each of the boards, but
not quite through them. By boring a hole just
above the button, we have an upper entrance,
with the button for an alighting board; in the
winter by turning this button perpendicularly,
it closes the upper entrance. To keep the portico
from slipping down, a nail is driven just
underneath the peak. This allows us to make
the upper and lower story just alike and yet
have a portico <i>if any body wants one</i>. After
testing hives with, and without, for two
seasons past, we really cannot think it makes
any difference either way with the honey crop.
Our friend Dean says a portico encourages the
bees in hanging out of doors, and he wants <i>his</i>
bees in the hive. Now if the spiders should
persist in making a new web in these porticos
every morning, as they sometimes do in ours,
we can easily lift them off and put them away.
Some will probably always prefer porticos,
while others will not, as in other things.</p>

<p class='c020'>DEAR NOVICE:—Please say to the inquisitive ones,
through “<span class='sc'>Gleanings</span>,” that the $34.45 mentioned on
front cover of No. 6, Vol. 2, was the cost of the iron
work mentioned in the same sentence, at the factory.</p>

<p class='c026'>That the saws, bolts, belting, and lumber ran the
bill for materials up to about $48.00.</p>

<p class='c026'>That I put the machine together myself, without
adding to the figures.</p>

<p class='c026'>That while the machine does do more accurate work,
than I have ever succeeded in having done, by more
portentous machinery; nevertheless, the idea of using
human muscles, as the motive power, for the amount
of work that looms up, prospectively, in the immediate
future, does not correspond, very well, with the boasted
ingenuity of this age and nation.</p>

<p class='c026'>Therefore I am preparing to “attach” a lever horse
power to the machine, by means of a belt thrown over
a pulley, placed on the driving shaft.</p>

<p class='c026'>This winter, in these parts, would do no discredit, to
an arctic region. This morning the mercury fell to 40°
below zero, and was still going down, when I took it
in out of the cold; because it had reached (and in fact
was a little below) the end of the graduated scale, at
40°. The mercury in the cellar, of late, keeps vibrating
about, and near to the freezing point. Bees quiet.</p>

<p class='c020'>How long will it take to feed 25 lbs. of sugar syrup
with the Universal feeder to an average colony of
bees in warm weather?</p>

<p class='c019'>We have never tested the matter, because
we deemed feeding a pint or a quart a day,
more desirable in preparing for winter, than
more rapid feeding. If the bags were made to
hold about a quart each, and were filled morning
noon and night, or oftener, we could probably
get them to take 25 lbs. in two or three
days, in warm weather.</p>

<p class='c020'>How will molasses hhds. answer for holding honey
temporarily? Say, take one head out—thoroughly
clean—heat in the sun—then coat the inside with hot
wax, using a brush for the purpose. When the honey
candies there will be no difficulty in getting it out.</p>

<p class='c019'>We would advise trying the plan you mention.
If you pour in a quantity of melted wax,
and run it all over the inside, it will assuredly
make it hold honey.</p>

<p class='c020'>How long before you can give us a simple and infallible
remedy for honey crystalizing? Such would be
worth a good deal to me as my whole crop is sold in
bottles and will not retail well in a solid state. For
the present, will heating to the boiling point in a vessel
set in water answer? Must the honey be bottled
and sealed while hot or will it do as well when cold?</p>

<p class='c019'>We find no trouble when we follow directions
given heretofore, viz., heat your honey almost
to a boil, fill the jars full, and seal <i>at once</i>, while
hot, just as if it were fruit. If not made hot
enough, it will candy again partially. We
think the writers who say that <i>pure</i> honey will
<i>always</i> candy, a little hasty.</p>

<p class='c020'>The frames in my hives rest on a metal rabbet and
are not secured at the bottom. They slide about very
easily. When I send off a load of hives to an apiary, I
secure the frames by placing half inch strips reaching
to the bottom board between the combs at each end.
It takes considerable time to fix them. Can you devise
anything that will be less bother and answer equally
well?</p>

<p class='c019'>To be sure if we have frames perfectly <i>movable</i>,
they must of a necessity be made stationery
when we wish to transport colonies and the
question arises as to whether it is advisable to
be bothered with any arrangement for keeping
frames fixed, every time we open a hive, just
because we have once in a great while
a case that makes such an arrangement desirable.
In moving our bees to the swamp, see
Vol. 1, page 75, we put strips between all of the
end bars to the frames, except one hive which
was overlooked, but as this hive had not been
opened at all, the bridge of wax from one comb
to the next, kept the frames all in their places.
This is generally sufficient for moving short
distances, where the combs have been in use
several years, and where they have not been
taken out for some little time before moving.
In shipping bees considerable distances, we
know of no plan better than the sticks. Something
could be added to the hive for this when
making, but would it be advisable, when the
hive in many apiaries may not require to be
moved in years? In moving the hives in doors
and out, even with Metal Corners as well as
rabbets, no preparation is needed, if the hives
are carried so that the frames do not oscillate
by the motion of stepping.</p>

<p class='c020'>Are Basswood trees ornamental, and of rapid
growth? Would they grow here? Our climate will
admit of the culture of the hardier varieties of grapes.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>DEAR NOVICE:—I am in favor of deep frames for
these reasons: Experience has convinced me that
bees winter better and breed earlier in deep than in
shallow frames. In hollow trees: the natural home of
the bee (and the one they like most) the
depth is always greater than the width. In shallow
frames they have to spread out so thin, or cluster on
the cold honey, that it makes it much harder to keep
up the necessary warmth. They seem to think they
must have bees where they have honey; and I have
noticed these outside guards often get chilled and die
at their post. The natural place for bees to store
honey, is in the top of their combs; and when they
want to know what they have in store they look for it
there; hence we often see them start from the cluster
run over the honey as if estimating it then pass into
the cluster, doubtless to report. When the honey is
directly over them I think they are more fully impressed
with its possessions. A hive 12×12 and 16
inches in depth I believe is the best size and shape for
wintering. Such a hive will allow plenty of honey in
the top and enough empty comb at the bottom for the
bees to cluster on, and keep in a round form which is
certainly the best. But it will be said shallow frames
are handier—should we not try to please our bees as
well as ourselves? Again they swing together too
badly—cannot some fixture be made to keep them
apart? What says Novice?</p>

<p class='c019'>But bees die in hollow trees nearly, if not
quite as badly as in hives; as new swarms
generally select these vacated hollow trees, we
forget that not one colony, but a half dozen
may have occupied the tree in a dozen years.
We know bees run over the combs, frequently,
but we can hardly accept the idea that they do
it exactly for the reason mentioned. We do
not use shallow frames for the reason that they
are handier. See pages 16, Vol. 1, and 29, Vol.
2. If hives and frames are properly made, they
can be made to hang true even when 16 inches
deep.</p>

<p class='c020'>FRIEND NOVICE:—My hives are 15½ inches wide
for ten frames; would they be any better if narrower?
Will bees work as well in small frames for surplus
honey as in boxes? Do you think the bee business
will ever be over-done in the United States?</p>

<p class='c019'>If you mean that you put ten frames in a
space of 15½ inches we should advise using
eleven frames instead of ten. If you mean 15½
is the length of top bar, we should consider it
as good as any unless you use your hives two
story, in which case a little longer frame might
be better. Small frames put inside of larger
ones, have often been tried but there are many
difficulties; they must be made very accurately,
to stay in place, the bees do not seem to like
so much wood in their way, every thing is covered
with propolis, and their owner generally
concludes that the arrangement is too much
bother to use on a large number of hives. We
have just as much fear that too much butter
and cheese will be produced, or too many eggs,
as that the market will ever be overstocked
with honey. What has been the result with
small fruits? Remember too that they are
perishable goods, while honey will keep safely
for years.</p>

white sugar.</p>

<p class='c026'>Now friend Novice, I want some advice. I want to
adopt some other hive than the Buckeye, but I want a
two story hive that I may procure, not box honey, but
frame honey, and I want the frames in both stories
alike so I may use them interchangeably.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>The bolted flue flour, is just as good as the
unbolted, except that the bees sink down in it.
If mixed with bran or sawdust it does very
well. When they can choose, bees always
prefer rye and oats, to wheat flour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Use the Langstroth frame by all means, if
you are going to have a two story hive. If
you have not seen the L. frame you had better
have us send you a sample by mail. We should
also use the Simplicity hives to hold them, for
then you can have both stories also, just alike,
and perfectly interchangeable. We can furnish
a one story hive, frames, quilt, and all complete
for $1.75, and <i>two of these</i> makes a complete
two story hive. We decidedly prefer the L.
frames for two story, on account of their shallowness,
any of the other frames loom up so
tall when placed one above the other. We
think we have ample evidence that the Langstroth
hive winters equally as well as any
deeper frame in any climate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our only reason for giving a preference to
the Standard frame over the Langstroth, under
any circumstances, is that more than 10 L.
frames, placed side by side, make a hive inconvenient
to make and inconvenient to handle.
Therefore if you are going to get your surplus
<i>above</i> the brood combs, use the L. frame every
time. The Quinby would come next to it, as
it is much the same thing on a larger scale, but
the American, Gallup, or Standard, are not
suitable to be used two stories as a general
thing. Single instances ’tis true, may sometimes
seem to point otherwise, but we have
<i>gleaned</i> the above from a large number of reports
extending over several years. Any
of the frames will we think, work very
well on the plan given on another page by
friend Joiner, but the last three mentioned
would stand a little the most compactly.</p>

<p class='c019'>So much time has been wasted in discussing
this question that it is questionable whether it
be best to hazard an opinion, until we can
be <i>sure</i> of solving the question positively. If a
black Queen could be fertilized, <i>beyond mistake</i>,
by an Italian drone, we might readily decide
the matter, for we should then have one or two
banded workers, and black drones invariably.
Will those who are equal to this task, if any
such there be, please experiment and report.
Will. R. King, of Franklin, Ky., did claim to
have made such an experiment, but evidence
was brought forward almost immediately,
showing that his statements were only a series
of falsehoods. [See page 93, Vol. 1.] We see no
reason at present to doubt the experiments of
Langstroth and Berlepsch; besides we find
Italian workers, in almost all Apiaries of black
bees in our vicinity, but the colonies producing
them show only black drones.</p>

<p class='c006'>So long as our object is honey, and we
only procure Italians because they gather <i>more</i>
honey, we cannot see that the question matters
particularly either way. Every Apiary of 50
colonies should have at least one Imported
Queen, and all colonies should be made with
Queens reared from this one. You will then
have good bees in every hive without bothering
about drones at all. All Apiaries of less
than 50 stocks can have an Imported Queen’s
daughter—as they cost but $1.00 each, you can
buy 4 or 5 if need be, until you get one whose
workers suit you. Every one who rears Queens
<i>for sale</i> should <i>certainly</i> have an Imported
Queen. At the low price at which they are
now offered there is no excuse for such blundering,
and if our readers would decide to patronize
none but those having <i>bona fide</i> Imported
Queen mothers, advertisers would make haste
to supply themselves. The plea that Imported
Queens do not always produce three banded
workers, we think a mistake. All the reports
from Queens of the Nunn importation
agree without an exception that the workers
are not only three banded, but that they are
quite superior as honey gatherers. James Bolin’s
letter just at hand is a sample of one of
them.</p>

<p class='c020'>The idea of judging a Queen by her <i>looks</i> and granting
a diploma etc., on the strength of it, is simply ridiculous.
Concerning Imported Queens, I would say that
I obtained one of friend Nunn and if there are any
better ones anywhere I would like to know it. Her
progeny and those of Queens reared from her are the
very best workers I have in my Apiary.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
